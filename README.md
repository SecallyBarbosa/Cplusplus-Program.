# Cplusplus-Program.

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was to display a 12- and a 24- hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock. The problem that had to be solved was creating the correct menu and being able to add hours, minutes, and seconds.

#What did you do particularly well?
I did well on the code modularization and with responding to the user input. This project was the best graded out of the three throughout this course. 

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
My code could have been better if I worked more on the menu functionality. My code did entirely follow the rubric in terms of display. Improvements in this area would have made my code 100%

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Considering that this was the first project in the course, it was entirely difficult to write. Just learning to write C++ and using it in a big project took some getting used to. I am glad with the outcome considering it was my first project using this language. I could have went back to the textbook and looked over some tips to improve functionality, or used YouTube for advice.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Using industry standard best practices will definitely be transferable to other projects or course work. Creating a clear code and using comments will help my code remain clear and successful.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by using comments to make sure I was in line with my code and using clear code and common practices made it work smoothly.
